              <h3>Samurai and Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                A short strategic point-and-click game inspired by the film Seven Samurai (1954). Made over the course of two weeks as a class project.
              </p>
              <ul class="work__list">
                <p>Things I'm proud of:</p>
                <li>The difficulty level. In playtests, people who hadn't played before were sometimes able to beat the game, but people who had played before were still able to lose. It provided some amount of challenge but without being difficult enough to be frustrating.</li>
                <li>Faithfulness to source material. I put a good deal of work into ensuring the visual style, the narrative, and the numbers of villagers and bandits were all recognizably linked to the film, and I think I succeeded at that while still making the game something original that could stand on its own.</li>
                <p>Things I would do differently next time:</p>
                <li>The UI could have been a lot cleaner. I should have cut down the amount of text and organized it in a more intuitive way. I also should have made the map smaller, or allowed the player to interact with it.</li>
                <li>The combat. I don't think this was terrible, but this game is mainly an exploration of the recruiting and building mechanics in stages one and two. I think if I had included an actual combat system rather than designing the combat as an extension of the building mechanics, it would have been a better game.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>your best friend is the chosen one</h3>
              <p>
              A short text-based game in Twine that tells a coming-of-age story about a young teenager falling in love with her best friend.
              </p>
              <ul class="work__list">
                <p>Things I'm proud of:</p>
                <li>Choosing your favorite color. Your choice of favorite color is directly linked with the descriptions of your best friend, and I think this very successfully reflected the emotions I was looking to convey about how, especially when we are young, we build many aspects of our identities from those we care about and look up to.</li>
                <li>The writing style. I really wanted the tone of the writing to reflect a particular time in the main character's life, around 12-16 years old. I looked through old journals of mine and some short stories my friends and I wrote in that age range, and the stylistic choices I made when writing this game were directly drawn from those examples, such as the lack of capitalization or the very vague description of a "chosen one." I think this was absolutely a success.</li>
                <p>Things I would do differently next time:</p>
                <li>More interactivity. I could have added more interactive elements beyond the basic links. This was one of my earlier projects in Twine, and I wasn't very familiar with the more advanced options for interactive elements yet.</li>
                <li>Visual elements. I could have added some custom formatting or images so that the visual style would reinforce the emotional themes I was trying to evoke with the writing.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>
              Hello! I'm currently finishing up a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design at UCSC. I'll be graduating in June 2024.</p>
              <p>I do a lot of programming, but my first introduction to games and game design was through tabletop games, so I'm very excited about the growing overlap between the two 
              in the form of both digital tools for tabletop games and digital editions of existing tabletop games.</p> I'm also extremely interested in the design of combat systems, especially combat systems with stakes beyond the typical "kill or be killed and then respawn."</p>
              <p>
              I'm primarily focused on the technical aspects of game design, and I enjoy fine-tuning the small or subtle components of a game that nonetheless are integral to the narrative immersion and feel of the game.
              <br>
